# Movie Theater Seating

## Approach 1:
Go through the list of inputs chronologically and assign seats from left to right until a row is full, and repeat this until the whole cinema is full. </br>
</br>
Tradeoff: May have leftover seats for each row where no other groups can fit into. </br>
Solution: Split up remaining groups to hopefully allow some more people who have reserved into the theatre.
